# vue3withsalesforce

This project shows how to add vuejs 3 into salesforce.

Here are the steps that we will take:

1. Making sure you have a Salesforce Org
2. Installing Vuejs
3. Setting up vuejs to work with Salesforce
4. Deploying your vue app to Salesforce


# 1. Make sure you have a DevOrg that you can work.
1. Any org you can create a domain and component should work.
1.1. You also need the My Domain.
1.1. Here is a quickly doc on how to do it.


# 2. Installing Vue

1. Create a folder called vue3withSalesforce
    1. mkdir vue3withSalesforce
2. Access the folder and install vue3 using VueCli
    1. cd vue3withSalesforce
    2. npm install -g @vue/cli
    3. vue create vue-app
    4. I selected every option as default on vue installation.
3. Testing your app
    1. cd vue-app
    2. npm run serve


# 3. Setting up vuejs to work with Salesforce

1. Changing Vue Configuration
    1. We also need to tell vue to change the path of the file.
    2. Create a file in the root(same place as you have the package.json) called vue.config.js
    3. Add this content in the vue.config.js

module.exports = {
    // options...
    publicPath: './',
};

# 4. Deploying your vue app to Salesforce

1. Letâ€™s compile and deploy the app to Salesforce
2. In the vue-app folder build the app
    1. npm run build
        1. This command will create a dist folder
3. Creating the static resource
    1. Go inside of dist folder in your Windows Explore or Finder
    2. Select all the files and zip/compress that
        1. Do NOT zip the dist folder, zip only the files
    3. You can give any name, Ex. vueapp
    4. Go to your salesforce org
    5. Setup >> Static Resources >> Import that file
4. Now we need to create the Salesforce Container that will use that static file.
5. Open the Developer Console
6. File >> New >> Lightning Component
    1. Name: vueappbundle
    2. Enable the Lightning Page.
    3. Click on Submit.
7. The component will open for you.
8. Click on Component
9. Add the code below
<aura:component implements="flexipage:availableForAllPageTypes" access="global" >
	<lightning:container src="{!$Resource.vueapp + '/index.html'}" />
</aura:component>
10. Add these styles to make your iframe responsive.
/** Making the iFrame Responsive - Begin **/
.THIS.lightningContainer>iframe{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

.THIS.lightningContainer {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
}
/** Making the iFrame Responsive - End **/
